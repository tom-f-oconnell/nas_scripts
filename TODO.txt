- find cause of processes i'm running via ssh freezing:
  - is it network related? could it be improved by using a different network
    connection on the back?

  - is it related to io on the particular USB drive i'm running the OS from?
    maybe try switching to a SSD?


  symptoms:
  - programs will freeze for ~tens of seconds - minutes, and their output won't
    update. this is often VIM, but just cause i'm using it the most i think.
    i've also seen it in a `sudo apt upgrade` call, i believe?

  - the problem did seem to get worse in other terminals when i was running the
    upgrade

  - not all terminals are affected at the same time. i might have two terminals,
    each with vim editing something, and it has affected one but not the other.


- determine (via docs / maybe benchmarking) whether it would make more sense to
  use a particular ethernet port on the back of the machine

  - also, does this mobo support + my current switch link aggregation (or
    whatever the right term is), to use multiple for the same connections (for
    higher speeds)?


- add instructions [+ utilities?] for backing up / restoring system partition
  (one currently on the USB drive plugged in to the motherboard) (and do it...)


- some organization to separate out scripts intended to be used manually vs
  those just for automated stuff (probably move all automated stuff to
  subfolder?)


- figure out how to [and whether i want to] disable mlocatedb that does a lot of (i think?) unnecessary
  IO every so often: https://askubuntu.com/questions/268130


- add logging to HDD temperature data (ideally with some display functions...
  maybe upload to some iot thing for that, ideally encrypted)

- finish script to install + configure smartd and that mail program

- actually test smartd email notifications with that failed drive i have from
  lab? (i know the email works via '-M test' + daemon restart, but don't know
  the format / whether it would actually trigger w/ a drive w/ a decent amount
  of bad sectors like this)
