- add logging to HDD temperature data (ideally with some display functions...
  maybe upload to some iot thing for that, ideally encrypted)

- add command (bash function?) that prints anything using drives
  - + one that checks they are in min power state (to spin down)
    (+ sets maybe)
  - + one that checks whether they are currently spinning
