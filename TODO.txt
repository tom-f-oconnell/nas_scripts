- add logging to HDD temperature data (ideally with some display functions...
  maybe upload to some iot thing for that, ideally encrypted)

- add command (bash function?) that prints anything using drives
  - + one that checks they are in min power state (to spin down)
    (+ sets maybe)
  - + one that checks whether they are currently spinning

- finish script to install + configure smartd and that mail program

- actually test smartd email notifications with that failed drive i have from
  lab? (i know the email works via '-M test' + daemon restart, but don't know
  the format / whether it would actually trigger w/ a drive w/ a decent amount
  of bad sectors like this)
